## Setup Cloud Side (KubeEdge Master Node)

By default ports `10000` and `10002` in your cloudcore needs to be accessible for your edge nodes.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:**
>
> 1. At least one of kubeconfig or master must be configured correctly, so that it can be used to verify the version and other info of the k8s cluster.
> 2. Please make sure edge node can connect cloud node using local IP of cloud node, or you need to specify public IP of cloud node with `--advertise-address` flag.âˆ‚
> 3. `--advertise-address` is the address exposed by the cloud side (will be added to the SANs of the CloudCore certificate), the default value is the local IP.
